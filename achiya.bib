  abstract  = {As we are moving towards the Internet of Things (IoT), the number of sensors deployed around the world is growing at a rapid pace. Market research has shown a significant growth of sensor deployments over the past decade and has predicted a significant increment of the growth rate in the future. These sensors continuously generate enormous amounts of data. However, in order to add value to raw sensor data we need to understand it. Collection, modelling, reasoning, and distribution of context in relation to sensor data plays critical role in this challenge. Context-aware computing has proven to be successful in understanding sensor data. In this paper, we survey context awareness from an IoT perspective. We present the necessary background by introducing the IoT paradigm and context-aware fundamentals at the beginning. Then we provide an in-depth analysis of context life cycle. We evaluate a subset of projects (50) which represent the majority of research and commercial solutions proposed in the field of context-aware computing conducted over the last decade (2001-2011) based on our own taxonomy. Finally, based on our evaluation, we highlight the lessons to be learnt from the past and some possible directions for future research. The survey addresses a broad range of techniques, methods, models, functionalities, systems, applications, and middleware solutions related to context awareness and IoT. Our goal is not only to analyse, compare and consolidate past research work but also to appreciate their findings and discuss their applicability towards the IoT.},

  abstract  = {``Tian Tuo 1'' (TT-1) nano-satellite is the first single-board nano-satellite that was successfully launched in China. The main objective of TT-1 is technology demonstration and scientific measurements. The satellite carries out the significant exploration of single-board architecture feasibility validation, and it is tailored to the low-cost philosophy by adopting numerous commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components. The satellite is featured with three-axis stabilization control capability. A pitch bias momentum wheel and three magnetic coils are adopted as control actuators. The sun sensors, magnetometers and a three-axis gyro are employed as the measurement sensors. The quaternion estimator (QUEST) and unscented Kalman filter (UKF) method are adopted for the nano-satellite attitude determination. On-orbit data received by ground station is conducted to analysis the performance of attitude determination and control system (ADCS). The results show that the design of ADCS for TT-1 is suitable, robust and feasible.},

Context, which can be a location, a user, an actual activity, or physical conditions, plays a major role in such systems. Actually, everything we refer to in our systems can be considered as context. To cope with this new situation, mechanisms for managing context were devised, including frameworks and programming languages. However, modeling languages that address the notion of context are rare. In this paper, we aim at framing and further defining the requirements for context modeling languages. Such a conceptualized framework sets the ground for designing and evaluatingmodeling languages for context-aware systems. We demonstrate a possible use of the proposed framework through the evaluation of CO-LSC, a context-oriented modeling language},

  abstract       = {Automatically generating executable code has a long history of arguably modest success, mostly limited to the generation of small programs of up to 200 lines of code, and genetic improvement of existing code. We present the use of genetic programming (GP) in conjunction with context-oriented behavioral programming (COBP), the latter being a programming paradigm with unique characteristics that facilitate automatic coding. COBP models a program as a set of behavioral threads (b-threads), each aligned to a single behavior or requirement of the system. To evolve behavioral programs we design viable and effective genetic operators, a genetic representation, and evaluation methods. The simplicity of the COBP paradigm, its straightforward syntax, the ability to use verification and formal-method techniques to validate program correctness, and a program comprising small independent chunks all allow us to effectively generate behavioral programs using GP. To demonstrate our approach we evolve complete programs from scratch of a highly competent O player for the game of tic-tac-toe. The evolved programs are well structured, consisting of multiple, explainable modules that specify the different behavioral aspects of the program and are similar to our handcrafted program. To validate the correctness of our individuals, we utilize the mathematical characteristics of COBP to analyze program behavior under all possible execution paths. Our analysis of an evolved program proved that it plays as expected more than 99% of the times.},

  abstract = {Context-aware systems keep on emerging as an intrinsic part of everyday activities. To cope with such situations, programming languages are extended to support the notion of context. Although context-oriented programming languages exist for over 15 years, they were tested for their suitability for developing context-aware systems only to a limited extent. In this paper, we propose a framework for analyzing the suitability of context-oriented languages from a wider viewpoint. Using this framework, we are able to examine context definition and activation, reasoning capabilities, process aspects of how to work with the language, and other pragmatic considerations. To demonstrate the use of the framework, we apply it to analyze three context-oriented programming languages: ServalCJ, Subjective-C, and COBPjs which represent the major Context-Oriented Programming themes. We evaluate the capabilities of each language using the purposed framework. Developers of context-oriented programming languages can use the framework to improve their languages and the associated development and supporting tools. Furthermore, such analysis can support users of context-oriented programming languages in deciding the language that best suits their needs.},
